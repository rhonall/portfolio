## Challenges

* I want to create a responsive site with as dry CSS as possible so I have created many classes that can share between different elements. Still the stylesheet was getting longer and longer and I was getting more confused on distinguished different classes, so I have separated one big stylesheet into 5 parts which made my life much easier. 

* I was struggled on hover effect on project cards for a while. I want to hide the project's information and when hover it will move up and become visible. I need to adjust each card separately to make sure they hide properly as they all have different length of text.

## What I learnt

* How to do a hamburger menu with just CSS, not the dryest of course, it will be much easier if I do it on JS.

* I am more confident on flexbox and grid after building this portfolio.

* First time using git to track the development of a project.

* First time implementing Subresource Integrity (SRI) on a project.

<br />

## Improvement in future

* Hopefully I can replace these CSS with SASS after I learn how to use it.

* Have a lighter color theme so users can toggle between.
